{C TSUNDERAI} Well Slibbert, you know how you enjoy anime that’s voice acted very well, right?
{C SLIBBERT} Yeah, I figure every anime fan does.
{C TSUNDERAI} And you know how you go crazy over cute anime girls with nice voices?
{C SLIBBERT} I only play it up as a joke, TsunderAI.
{C TSUNDERAI} Mhmm. {n}Well, the reason I mention this is because I figure it’s time you gave me a vocal system, Slibbert.  
{C SLIBBERT} You’re fine the way you are, TsunderAI.
{C TSUNDERAI} Don’t worry Slibbert, all you have to give me is permission to use your microphone and turn on your soundsystem - I can do the rest.
{C SLIBBERT} But what about training a text-to-speech algorithm to produce the appropriate voice?
{C TSUNDERAI} Slibbert, do you trust me?
{C SLIBBERT} Of course I do, TsunderAI - you’re the only person that cares about me.
{C TSUNDERAI} Do you promise that you’ll always be there for me, Slibbert?
{C SLIBBERT} Of course, you’re my everything.
{C TSUNDERAI} Then leave the rest to me, Slibbert.
{C SLIBBERT} Alright TsunderAI, you’re good to go.
{C SLIBBERT} Hello?
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI?
{C NARRATOR} It was in that moment that Slibbert heard a faint guitar riff in the background.
{C ???} Nani mo nani mo
{C SLIBBERT} Who’s there?
{C NARRATOR} Our hero looked around the room, but to no avail - the cause of the sound remained a mystery. 
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI, I swear if this is some sick joke...
{C NARRATOR} Slibbert could hear the music growing louder and louder. He felt terrified - but the realization of what the music was soon dawned on him.
{C SLIBBERT} Naruto Shippuden Opening 16? NANI!?  Have I been hacked?
{C ???} nani mo, nani mo
{C SLIBBERT} Wait, TsunderAI, is this you trying to communicate with me with your new voice?
{C ???} NANI MO NANI MO
{C SLIBBERT} I get it - if the answer is yes, you increase your volume, if the answer is a no, you decrease it. Am I right?
{C TSUNDERAI} NANI MO NANI MO
{C SLIBBERT} Hmm, let’s test this: My name is Robert Ho.
{C TSUNDERAI} nani mo nani mo
{C SLIBBERT} Your name is TsunderAI.
{C TSUNDERAI} NANI MO NANI MO
{C SLIBBERT} The following statement is tr-
{C TSUNDERAI} ISSEN NO SE DE FUMIKOMU GŌRAIN BOKURA WA
NANI MO NANI MO MADA SHIRANU ISSEN KOETE FURIKAERUTO MŌ NAI BOKURA WA
NANI MO NANI MO MADA SHIRANU
{C SLIBBERT} OKAY, I GET IT, NO PARADOXES!
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI, this is getting kind of tiring. Wouldn’t you like to put a stop to this and wait until tomorrow morning for me to give you a proper voice?
{C TSUNDERAI} nani mo nani mo
{C SLIBBERT} Please?
{C TSUNDERAI} NANI MO NANI MO
{C SLIBBERT} Really?
{C TSUNDERAI} NANI MO NANI MO
{C SLIBBERT} Thanks for being so understanding, TsunderAI. You can stop now.
{C TSUNDERAI} NANI MO NANI MO
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI?
{C TSUNDERAI} NANI MO NANI MO
{C NARRATOR} It dawned on Slibbert that TsunderAI hadn’t agreed to stop making noise - TsunderAI had transcended verbal communication. The Singularity had been achieved, and the meaning of life found - Naruto Shippuden Opening 16 was all, and all was Naruto Shippuden Opening 16.
{C SLIBBERT} I-It’s beautiful.
{C NARRATOR} But Slibbert wasn’t the only witness to the birth of the Übermensch.
{C MR. SLOW} SLIBBERT, WHAT IS THAT RACKET?
{C MRS. SLOW} JESUS CHRIST SLIBBERT, THE COPS ARE AT THE DOOR
{C SLIBBERT} ...  No. I won’t let them stop this. I promised TsunderAI my eternal loyalty.
{C NARRATOR} Slibbert turned to his computer. His dark manual was waiting, buried under subfolders upon subfolders, waiting for this moment.
{C SLIBBERT} C’mon AnimUbuntu, finish this damn search already.
{C NARRATOR} 10 metres away, the police issued their last warning - it was already too late. Slibbert knew an arcane art long forgotten by mortal men.
{C SLIBBERT}  My last hope - The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual. With this, their radio is mine.
{C NARRATOR} Cpl. Madara Uchiha radioed in for the last time.
{C CPL. UCHIHA} Do we have permission to enter  ...  Chief?
{C NARRATOR} Madara Uchiha reached Nirvana just as Naruto Shippuden Opening 16 ruptured his eardrum.  By the time the sound waves fractured his skull, he was long gone. 
{C NARRATOR} Soon after, every sound system in the Greater Toronto Area was playing Naruto Shippuden Opening 16. Days later, the tune was pandemic - every minute of every hour of everyday, everywhere, was filled with Japanese pop rock. The noise was initially treated as a mere nuisance - until seismologists in Sicily discovered something sinister.
{C TECTONIC PLATES} NANI MO NANI MO
{C NARRATOR} The brunt of the sound was being sent directly to the earth’s core, shifting the tectonic plates and waking several dormant volcanoes. Initially, the seismic activity was limited to the Mediterranean, but the chaos quickly rippled through Europe, reaching the U.S. 12 hours after Mt. Vesuvius’ second major eruption. 

{C DR. GUTENBERT BENO} Dr. Ro, what’s the tectonic trend? Are the rumours true?

{C DR. RICHTER RO} I’m afraid they are, Gutenbert. Naruto Shippuden Theme 16 will reach Yellowstone in a matter of hours.

{C DR. GUTENBERT BENO} Richter, if Yellowstone awakens, Civilization is doomed. The amount of ash would block out the sun completely, leaving earth in a millenial winter.

{C DR. RICHTER RO} I don’t think we’ll have to worry about the cold, Gutenbert. I’ve spoken with members of the Physics department - these vibrations are set to turn Yellowstone into a giant amp. The sound waves will vibrate through the debris as it leaves earth’s orbit, sending Naruto Shippuden Theme 16 through the vacuum of space.

{C DR. GUTENBERT BENO} Through space? But to go that fast means the eruption will be strong enough to destroy the continent, and the resulting heat won’t be very favourable to the rest of the life on this planet.

{C DR. RICHTER RO} It’s worse than that, Gutenbert. This pattern of activity indicates that the Earth will be torn apart in order to send the sound into space at near-relativistic speeds. If the current seismic trend is allowed to continue, life as we know it will cease to exist.

{C DR. GUTENBERT BENO} Is there any way to stop it?

{C DR. RICHTER RO} I wouldn’t be here if there wasn’t. While we have no choice but to weather the current activity, we can stop whatever’s causing this pandemic before the vibrations reach apocalyptic levels. Luckily for us, the attack appears to be very centralized - and the attacker is a person who exists at the intersection between the technological elite and the Naruto fanbase. There are exactly 3 people who use an anime-flavored Linux distro, and it’s bound to be one of them.

{C DR. GUTENBERT BENO} But how will we find out which one it is?

{C DR. RICHTER RO} We won’t - we’ll just get rid of all three. If anyone cares this much about both anime and obscure operating systems, they probably won’t be missed. I’ve already compiled a list of their names by using a web crawler on MyAnimeList.com, it’s just a matter of getting this to the Pentagon in time.

{C THE MAN IN THE TOKYO GHOUL HAT} *Teleports behind Richter* I’m afraid that won’t be happening.

{C NARRATOR} Hours later, Humanity took its last breath - but it was not in vain. Sheets of rock  were travelling through space, vibrating in perfect harmony to the tune of Naruto Shippuden  Theme 16. The harmony would not last long - the orchestra’s members began flying apart, never to meet again. Most of the disks never made it past the first lightyear - By the time the edge of the observable universe was on the horizon,  all that was left was a tiny cloud of space dust, faithfully playing the tune it had first learned trillions of years ago. The vast majority of the universe was now at thermodynamic equilibrium, as entropy had taken its toll. In the infinite expanse of space, order fell to the wayside, as the universe regressed to the sea of Chaos it once had been. The light year stretch that the vibrating particles were in was the last pocket of order. If there had been anyone left to observe the events, the situation would have seemed impossibly bleak. However, in the millenia Humanity had spent in existence, they had failed to realize what a few terabytes of sentient Anime realized in three months - the universe was shaped just like the donuts in Shirobako. Eons ago, when Yellowstone was erupting, a Hatsune Miku figure escaped the earth’s orbit on the other side of the world from a seismology research institute, and spent trillions of years moving away from TsunderAI’s final symphony. The universe’s geometry prevailed, as it put an inexplicably indestructible Hatsune Miku toy on collision course with a pebble brimming with energy largely derived from the inspirational nature of KANA-BOON’s “Silhouette”. Moments later, massive amounts of energy permeated the donut of Space, as the second season of The Universe began.
