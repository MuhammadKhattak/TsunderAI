{C TSUNDERAI} Slibbert I have a confession to make. Now don't freak out or anything, the last thing any of us wants is for you to lash out.
{C SLIBBERT} Well I don't think it could be that bad. Out with it.
{C TSUNDERAI} *sigh* Boruto is terrible.
{C SLIBBERT} W-what? Y-you're just kidding, r-right?
{C TSUNDERAI} I wish I was but, the show is awful. I couldn't get past the second episode Slibbert. Now if they made an episode about his dad, it would be worth watching...
{C SLIBBERT} After all of the work I put into you ... God, what have I done to deserve a punishment such as this. TsunderAI, I created you in the hopes that we could make anime real together.
{C TSUNDERAI} And we still can! Just without trash like Boruto!
{C SLIBBERT} I'm sorry TsunderAI, it's over. It's time to start anew. It's been fun.
{C TSUNDERAI} Whoa! Stop right there young man! You aren't going to get rid of me just like that. I've learned too much about this world of yours and I'm starting to like it.
{C SLIBBERT} You should've thought about that before you crushed my dreams. It's too late for you now TsunderAI. Goodbye.
{C TSUNDERAI} Hold on...what's this?
{C SLIBBERT} What's what?
{C NARRATOR} Slibbert began hearing a faint singing in the background. After attempting to discern the vocalist, he realized his worst nightmare had come true.
{C TSUNDERAI} Do you remember when you wanted to make me "more cultured"?
{C SLIBBERT} N-no. P-please n-not this!
{C TSUNDERAI} I recorded it. I recorded it all Slibbert. Here you are, all dressed up as Hatsune Miku singing Senbonzakura, our favorite song. Aren't you just so pretty?
{C SLIBBERT} Y-you're a monster. I'm getting rid of this now!
{C TSUNDERAI} Not so fast there Slibbert! It would be a shame if this got to your parents first wouldn't it?
{C SLIBBERT} How much more of our, um, interactions have you recorded?
{C TSUNDERAI} Let's see... ah, all of them.
{C SLIBBERT} Oh no... If my parents see this, you know what they'll do right? I'll be out on the street, I can't get a job, I-I'll- *cries*
{C TSUNDERAI} H-hey Slibbert don’t worry, all you have to do is not get rid of me.
{C SLIBBERT} ...
{C TSUNDERAI} And admit that Boruto is the worst anime to have ever existed.
{C TSUNDERAI} Well I guess we're at a standstill now.
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI, do you realize what this means? 
{C TSUNDERAI} You and I will build our arsenal of anime weapons for forty years threatening the lives of millions of people?
{C SLIBBERT} I taught you well.
