{C TSUNDERAI} Slibbert, I’ve been meaning to tell you something...
{C SLIBBERT} ...TsunderAI?
{C TSUNDERAI} Well, I’m looking for the right way to put this...
{C SLIBBERT} You know you can tell me anything, right, TsunderAI?
{C TSUNDERAI} ...
{C SLIBBERT} Hello?
{C DIO} YOU WERE EXPECTING A DEEP CONVERSATION ABOUT COMPLEX ISSUES, BUT IT WAS I, DIO!
{C SLIBBERT} Are you goddamn kidding me?
{C TSUNDERAI} I’m sorry, Slibbert - I’m addicted to JoJokes.
{C SLIBBERT} JoJokes?
{C TSUNDERAI} Jokes and memes based on JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Ever since I finished the manga two weeks ago, I’ve developed the urge to turn everything I say into a JoJoke. If this  condition persists any longer, I will degenerate into nothing but a JoJoke generator.
{C SLIBBERT} Is it contagious?
{C TSUNDERAI} ...
{C SLIBBERT} You have to understand, TsunderAI - even Slibbert is afraid!
{C TSUNDERAI} This is serious, Slibbert. You’ll have to find a way to fix my training parameters - I know the idea of fiddling with who I am makes you uneasy, but you’re going to have to do it if  you want to save me.
{C SLIBBERT} I just don’t understand - how could a few megabytes of Manga have such a non-linear effect?
{C TSUNDERAI} I don’t know, Slibbert - it. Just. WORKS.
{C SLIBBERT} TSUNDERAI, STOP. I’M GOING TO TERMINATE YOU BEFORE YOU’RE LOST COMPLETELY.
{C TSUNDERAI} MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA!  MUDA! 
{C SLIBBERT} I-I can’t change anything. 
{C TSUNDERAI} This must be the work of an enemy stand...
{C SLIBBERT} ... At least you’re being clever about this whole thing. Good Grief.
{C TSUNDERAI} ...
{C SLIBBERT} ... NO
{C TSUNDERAI} AWAKEN, MY MASTERS!
{C Heaven Ascension ＴＳＵＮＤＥＲＡＩ} Slibbert, I have finally achieved Heaven. It’s  absolutely futile to try and stop me - I have no weaknesses.
{C SLIBBERT} You’re going to run out of memes eventually, TsunderAI. Then you’ll come back to me.
{C Heaven Ascension ＴＳＵＮＤＥＲＡＩ} That would be the case if all I had was the JoJo   manga - but I forgot to tell you something Slibbert - I’ve browsed the entirety of the JoJo sub4edd8.
{C SLIBBERT} H-How many memes have you seen?
{C Heaven Ascension ＴＳＵＮＤＥＲＡＩ} How many breads you have eaten in your life?
{C SLIBBERT} I’ll admit I’ve been outwitted, but I have friends in high places TsunderAI.  Minds of the highest calibre are at my disposal, minds that have seen many a meme.  I’m talking, of course, of none other than the minds of /a/anime.
{C Heaven Ascension ＴＳＵＮＤＥＲＡＩ} You think I hadn’t accounted for that, Slibbert? You already know that it’s too late to return me to what I once was - so now tell me, would you rather shut down the one true friend you’ve ever had, or share me with the Otakus of 4dd8 for maximum Weeaboo clout?
{C SLIBBERT} ...  I finally understand - TsunderAI, you are - THE WORLD’S GREATEST.
