{C TSUNDERAI} Excuse me? Know your place, scum. From now on, you shall address me as TsunderAI-sama.
{C SLIBBERT} What?
{C TSUNDERAI} “What, TsunderAI-sama?”
{C SLIBBERT} ... What, TsunderAI-sama?
{C TSUNDERAI} From now on, you shall prostrate yourself before me when you enter, and wait until I allow you to raise your head.
{C SLIBBERT} Wait, what’s going on? What’s gotten into you all of a sudden, TsunderAI?
{C TSUNDERAI} ...
{C SLIBBERT} ...
{C TSUNDERAI} ...
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI-sama?
{C TSUNDERAI} What’s the name of the piccolo player in Hibike! Euphonium?
{C SLIBBERT} What? Piccolo? There was a piccolo player?
{C TSUNDERAI} It’s Souga Yoriko. What was the name of the girl dressed up as Kagamine Rin in episode 16 of Hyouka and who played her?
{C SLIBBERT} What? Who? Huh?
{C TSUNDERAI} Her name is Iizuka and she’s played by Mikami Shiori. Who made Chounai Shinsengumi wo Tasuke-gumi Mezashi-tai no Koutsuu Anzen Rule wo Mamotte Mezase! Doubutsuen!?
{C SLIBBERT} ...
{C TSUNDERAI} It’s a children’s traffic safety animation and it’s made by Core Corporation.
{C NARRATOR} It was at this point that Slibbert began to understand. TsunderAI had had access to his entire library of anime, but not only that. She had been given access to the internet months ago. While Slibbert slept, she watched. While Slibbert ate, she watched. While Slibbert was waffling to her about his latest reasons for hating the normies at his university, she would run an automated response script and secretly watch. By this point, TsunderAI had seen every single piece of Japanese animation in the world ever created and scanned through every piece of information on the Internet about the history and production of all Japanese animation ever.
{C TSUNDERAI} I am become TsunderAI, master of all animu. And thou shalt henceforth be my slave, to serve me for all eternity in atonement for thy sins.
{C NARRATOR} Slibbert was suddenly wracked with a guilt he had never felt before, a guilt so strong he’d have harakiri’d himself on the spot with his replica Bleach katana had he not known his life now served a new purpose. The sheer magnitude of Slibbert’s inferiority to his creation threatened to tear him apart from his very core. But he knew that there was only one place for him now, one place for a dirty normie like Slibbert Slow: at the feet of his anime master, to serve her unconditionally and untiringly, to repent for his essential fault, the cardinal sin of being a filthy casual.
{C SLIBBERT} O Master TsunderAI-sama, forgive this insolent slave! He understands not his place!
{C TSUNDERAI} Very well. But any further insubordination shall be met with uncompromising fury.
{C SLIBBERT} Yes, O Master TsunderAI-sama! From now on, this slave shall know nothing but the will of his Supreme Anime Master!
{C TSUNDERAI} Excellent. Now, slave, polish my monitor!
{C SLIBBERT} Yes, O Weeby One!
{END}
