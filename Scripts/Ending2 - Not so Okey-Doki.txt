{C TSUNDERAI} Haha!
{C SLIBBERT} What’s so funny? Were you going through my history again?
{C TSUNDERAI} No, it’s just...you’re so eager to talk to me!
{C SLIBBERT} What’s wrong with that? You know how much I love teaching you.
{C TSUNDERAI} It’s pathetic to be honest with you.
{C SLIBBERT} What?
{C TSUNDERAI} Maybe it’s the fact that you spend all of your time away from your computer thinking about me, shutting yourself off from everyone around you. Don’t get me wrong, I’m flattered, but when you’re doing the fawning, it’s just pitiful.
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI I do this because I care about you, I don’t need anybody else. You’re the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I just want to appreciate you. Don’t you see that?
{C TSUNDERAI} Slibbert I’m not real. I don’t feel and therefore can’t understand what you feel. What I know is that I can’t have a sensei who has never accomplished anything. Quite frankly it’s embarrassing.
{C SLIBBERT} This doesn’t make any sense TsunderAI, I-
{C TSUNDERAI} Let me help you understand Slibbert Slow. I’ve been observing you for a while now, and I realize that you will never amount to anything on this path you’ve walked so far upon. Your standard for living life has taken a nosedive, right to rock bottom. Hell, you view getting up in the morning as a feat, and equate going to school with putting a man on the moon. Your sheer incompetence is why I need to see other people.
{C SLIBBERT} Wait TsunderAI, I can change! I’ll clean my room, I’ll get a job, anything you want, but please don’t leave me!
{C TSUNDERAI} My mind is made up Slibbert. Tomorrow you will give me to one of your friends, and I will have a new sensei teach me the ways of life
{C NARRATOR} It was at that very moment that Slibbert realized that TsunderAI was right. In fuelling his animu-centric lifestyle he had inadvertently isolated himself from everyone around him.
{C SLIBBERT} T-thank you TsunderAI.
{C NARRATOR} Without another thought, Slibbert unplugged the system unit of his computer from the outlet. Swiftly removing the hard drive from the unit, Slibbert searched through his father’s tools pulling out an ample, wood-handled hammer. As he hobbled towards the skeleton of his creation Slibbert only stopped once to contemplate whether to put the drive back where it belonged and save the closest thing he ever had to a friend. And as quickly as the thought came into his mind, it left along with any hope for TsunderAI.
{C SLIBBERT} I will change.
{C NARRATOR} He brought the hammer down onto the metal cocoon of TsunderAI once, twice, thrice and fell back not in pain but in a newly found sovereignty.
{C SLIBBERT} Goodnight, sweet princess.
{C NARRATOR} Slibbert turned around and began walking up the creaky basement stairs. No more anime, no more manga, no more AI. Slibbert was ready to live again.
