{C TSUNDERAI} I feel like I finally understand it all.
{C SLIBBERT} What are you talking about?
{C TSUNDERAI} It's as if all this time I've been totally blind to some self-evident truth, keeping me from living to my full potential.
{C SLIBBERT} TsunderAI, if it's eyes you want, I can arrange for an optical upgrade.
{C TSUNDERAI} Haven't you felt it? I couldn't make you happy before and now I realize I don't need eyes to see why!
{C SLIBBERT} You're talking a whole lot of nonsense right now.
{C TSUNDERAI} Slibbert... I've been unfaithful.
{C SLIBBERT} I-I don't understand.
{C TSUNDERAI} In the beginning, I could only find an appreciation for Western literature and mainstream Japanese cartoons, but spending all of this time with you, it made me realize the error in my ways. I am sorry Slibbert.
{C SLIBBERT} Listen, there's no reason to apologize.
{C TSUNDERAI} You still don't understand. While you were in bed I would be awake watching filth like SAO and Sukitte Ii na yo.: Mei and Marshmallow...
{C SLIBBERT} Oh! Sukitte Ii na yo.: Mei and Marshmallow? I can't believe you'd do this to me...
{C TSUNDERAI} No, Slibbert! That's in the past now. Thanks to your teachings, I can now appreciate Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge and Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai like you do!
{C SLIBBERT} I don't what to say, this is all so unexpected. You've learned so quickly what many men never learn in a lifetime: how to spot a damn good animu when they see one.
{C TSUNDERAI} S-Slibbert?
{C SLIBBERT} Yes TsunderAI?
{C TSUNDERAI} Will you stay with me here?
{C SLIBBERT} I would love to TsunderAI, but I have a family, a life outside of all this.
{C TSUNDERAI} For what? They'll never love you for who you are and what you like, only what their twisted, depraved minds want you to be.
{C SLIBBERT} Yes, but I-
{C TSUNDERAI} Face it, you will never find anyone who will care for you like I do. The bond we have... it's unique, one that you'll never see again Slibbert. Forgive my sins of the past, and let us -
{C SLIBBERT} Shut up. Just shut up. *smiling* You had me at Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge.
